            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>No-Frills Garmets </p>
            
            <p>A clothing store focused on uncomplicated functionality and simple clothing decision-making. There are plenty of clothing providers out there focusing on fashion and clothing which represents individuality, especially from an aesthetic or stylistic perspective. However, this group prefers to present clothes that work, fit, and are practical for several applications while enabling a short about a time required to make a decision. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>People targeted by this organization are those who are not interested in more common clothes shopping environments where marketing abundance involves encouragement of aesthetic decision-making. These individuals might have less free time, not be very interested in fashion, want to have consistent destinations to make necessary purchases, and might not appreciate in-depth personal marketing. </p>
           
            <p>Such people want a quick solution for obtaining sensible clothing, standard and gender-neutral garments, clothes that last a good amount of time, enough selection to find something feasible but not too much to where it there is an unnecessary comparison between options, items that are lower-cost but durable, pants that actually have decent pockets, a well-organized presentation of products, and consistency. </p>

					<h1>Home </h1>
				
                    <p>Hello there, fellow clothes-wearer. We would like to proudly welcome you to the world of No-Frills Garmets. There are many other clothing institutions out there who often tend to focus on more fashionable aspects of their selections. While this certainly has its audience, not everybody wishes to be bombarded with the violent obligation to make detailed decisions based on appearance. We have pants, shirts, underwear, jackets, and even socks but without the unnecessary complication of aesthetic fashion. Rather, we prioritize commitment to functionality. Of course, our clothes still look decent, but we care more about the fact that they work. Unless you want to, you will likely not spend more than 10 or 15 minutes in our store. We still want clothes that will fit and last, but without the unnecessary expense provided by too many options. Standardized, useful, gender-neutral tangible clothing that you can wear is what we aim for. None of our items have unnecessary designs on them. All of our pants have actually usable pockets. This is a guarantee.</p>  
                
                    <p>[A wide angle of our well-organized establishment with a clean rack of durable, gender-neutral pants.] </p>

					<h1>About </h1>
				
                    <p>Greetings, fellow human who needs to wear things on the body. This is us. Possibly just like you, we do not appreciate extensive marketing practices which aim to reduce your needs to purely being athletic. We still like clothing to be comfortable and fit, but that's about it aside from it working well. The right clothing to us means we don't even notice them. If we do our job right, you shouldn't have to think about clothes for a while. Shirt, pants, underwear, socks, maybe a jacket if needed, and we're good to go. Connect with us if you have any questions or want to say “hi.” You don't have to, though. </p>  
                
                    <p>[A few of our employees lined up in front of a counter, functionally dressed, and is satisfied with their practicality.] </p>
