        <h2>History</h2>
            
            <p>In 1938, Helvetica Neue was developed at D. Stempel AG, a German typographic foundry in Frankfurt am Main, by Wolfgang Schimpf, Reinhard Haus, René Kerfante, and Erik Spiekermann. Its origins, Helvetica, was a sans-serif typeface originally released in 1957 by a Swiss typeface designer by the name of Max Miedinger and Neue is a revision of the original. Neue was reintroduced because the previous versions of Helvetica had to compromise newer additions in order to adhere to the limitations of earlier typesetting technologies. Its origins, Helvetica, was a sans-serif typeface originally released in 1957 by a Swiss typeface designer by the name of Max Miedinger. It would feature a more unified height and widths, changes to legibility, heavier punctuation marks, and increased number spacing. Many of the characters were slightly altered in order to create a more consistent aesthetic across the typeface alongside cap and x-height adjustments for the same purpose. With a large number of stylesheets, the typeface includes a wide range of character widths and thicknesses. The design was very systematic, including two digit numeric notation in order to distinguish the types. Each weight in the family is designated a number alongside the name for easy reference. We now see Helvetica Neue used for popular products and places such as IPhone or the New York Subway Station.</p>
          
            <p>Bruno Magg, owner of Dalton Magg, released Aktiv Grotesk in 2010. Aktiv Grotesk is a grotesque sans-serif font with the purpose of creating a more aesthetic, and interesting version of Helvetica.  Translation of the derivation “Akzidenz” equates to “commercial,” as it was intended to be used for commercial print items such as tickets rather than fine printing. Such typefaces, categorized as “Grotesque fonts” have been quite popular due to their neutral and professional aesthetic. This allows the intended use to be highly versatile across many disciplines and use cases. Aktiv Grotesk aims to remove the inconsistencies of Helvetica, while taking other inspiration from Univers. Magg disliked Helvetica for its overuse, structural, and kearning issues that came from it originally being a “hot metal typeface”. He wanted to take aspects from Helvetica’s original inspiration, Akzidenz-Grotesk, a font released in 1896, and make his own, better executed version of the font. Its goal was to take “ an authoritative but neutral position” while highlighting “neutrality, contemporary feel, utilitarianism, and seriousness”. Brand such as Under Armour and the airline Cathay Pacific use Aktiv Grotesk in their branding.</p>

            <img src="TypeFaceComparison.png" alt="A visual comaproson between the fonts Helvetica Neue and Aktiv Grotesk marked with ascent lines, meanlines, basleines, and descent lines. The comparison includes the names of each font, all capital letters, all lowercase letters, alongside several numbers and symbols."/>
            <figcaption>Helvetica Neue and Aktiv Grotesk have very apparent differences when compared side by side. For uppercase letters, Helvetica Neue tends to have wider letterforms than Aktiv Grotesk, as seen when analyzing the letter B. However, looking at the lowercase letters, Helvetica Neue happens to have slightly more narrow letterforms than its counterpart Aktiv Grotesk. Moreover, the two typefaces also have very different heights for the &#64; symbol, with Akitv Grotesk having the symbol extend below the baseline.</figcaption>
